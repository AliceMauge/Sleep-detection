# Sleep-detection<br>
Based on a Kaggle competetion: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states<br>
In this repository I train a model on wrist-worn accelerometer data to predict events:<br>
-when the person who wears the accelerometer falls asleep<br>
-when they wake up
